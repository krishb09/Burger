SUMMARY:

In this assignment, we created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Utilized the MVC design pattern; used Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

Used the MYSQL Heroku Deployment Guide in order to deploy this assignment.
